# Multimodal Clock using VGA and FPGA

  The goal of this project was to learn more about HDLs and implementation of combinational+sequential logic on FPGAs. Contributions were made by Eric Chen, Emika Hammond, and Sora Kakigi, for the purpose of EC311 at Boston University.

## Specificiations
The FPGA used in this project is the Digilent Nexys A7-100T. The attached [.xdc constraint file](/Nexys4DDR_Master.xdc) is the only constraint file necessary. The inputs to the top module are defined in this file and the following image:
